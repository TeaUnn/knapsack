Description: The package contains different functions for solving what is called the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a discrete optimization problem where we have a knapsack that can take a limited weight W and we want to fill this knapsack with a number of items i = 1, ..., n, each with a weight w[i] and a value v[i]. The goal is to find the knapsack with the largest value of the elements added to the knapsack.
